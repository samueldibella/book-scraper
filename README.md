#Scripts for scraping book data online

##isbn-to-metadata
This program reads an input text file of ISBN-13 strings, separated by newlines, searches WorldCat and Google Books, using isbnlib methods, and exports matching titles, authors, and pub years (+ original ISBN-13 number) into a .csv. That .csv can then easily be imported into Excel for analysis.
